# Cryptocurrency is all the rage. You have decided to create your own,
# KelloggCoin, that will massively disrupt financial markets at the Global
# Hub.

# Don't change the following code, which represents a series of transactions, each
# of which represents a transfer of KelloggCoin from one user to another – the first 
# transaction is the "ICO" (Initial Coin Offering)
blockchain = [
  { :from_user => nil, :to_user => "brian", :amount => 21000 },
  { :from_user => "brian", :to_user => "ben", :amount => 9000 },
  { :from_user => "brian", :to_user => "jeff", :amount => 7000 },
  { :from_user => "ben", :to_user => "jeff", :amount => 400 },
  { :from_user => "brian", :to_user => "jeff", :amount => 1500 },
  { :from_user => "jeff", :to_user => "brian", :amount => 4500 },
  { :from_user => "jeff", :to_user => "ben", :amount => 1750 }
]

# Write code below that returns the number of KelloggCoin that each user has in their 
# KelloggCoin "wallet".

n_transactions = blockchain.length

#Get the unique users
unique_customers = []
for i in (0...n_transactions)
  if (blockchain[i][:from_user] !=  nil)
    unique_customers = unique_customers.append(blockchain[i][:from_user])
  end  
  if (blockchain[i][:to_user] != nil)
    unique_customers = unique_customers.append(blockchain[i][:to_user])
  end
end

unique_customers = unique_customers.uniq
n_customers = unique_customers.length

#Get total balance
total_balance = []
for u in unique_customers
  aux = 0
  for i in (0...n_transactions)
    if (blockchain[i][:from_user] == u)
      aux = aux - blockchain[i][:amount]
    elsif (blockchain[i][:to_user] == u)
      aux = aux + blockchain[i][:amount]
    end
  end
  total_balance = total_balance.append(aux)
end

wallet_balance ={
    :customer => unique_customers, :balance => total_balance
}

for i in (0...n_customers) 
  puts "#{wallet_balance[:customer][i]}'s KelloggCoin balance is #{wallet_balance[:balance][i]}."
end

# It should print out:
# Brian's KelloggCoin balance is 8000
# Ben's KelloggCoin balance is 10350
# Jeff's KelloggCoin balance is 2650

# Notes...
# Build a solution that assumes there are only these three participants. If you can do that,
# and you're itching for more, think about if there other ways to implement the solution that 
# are more flexible; i.e. what if we added someone new to the blockchain? is there a way to 
# do this where we wouldn't have to rewrite the code?
